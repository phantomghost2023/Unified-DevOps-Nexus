# Unified DevOps Nexus

A robust, extensible, and AI-powered DevOps orchestration platform for multi-cloud infrastructure. Unified DevOps Nexus provides a unified engine for configuration, validation, optimization, and deployment across multiple cloud providers, with deep test coverage and structured error handling.

## Features
- **UnifiedEngine**: Central engine for loading, validating, and deploying infrastructure configurations to multiple providers.
- **AIOptimizer**: AI-driven configuration optimization and validation (OpenAI integration).
- **Custom Exceptions**: Structured error handling for all core operations.
- **Extensible Providers**: Easily add new cloud providers or custom deployment logic.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 95%+ test coverage, including edge cases, error branches, and performance benchmarks.
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Automated scaling and edge-case tests using `pytest-benchmark`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

### Installation
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Tests
```sh
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Running Performance Benchmarks
```sh
pytest tests/performance/test_edge_cases.py --benchmark-only
```

## Usage Example
```python
from src.core.engine.unified_engine import UnifiedEngine
engine = UnifiedEngine('path/to/config.yaml')
results = await engine.deploy()
```

## Configuration Example
See `tests/fixtures/test_config.yaml` for a sample configuration file structure.

## Error Handling
All errors are raised as custom exceptions (see `src/core/exceptions.py`) and are logged with structured messages for easy debugging and monitoring.
